# ETL data on CPU and simultaneously Training model on GPU using TFDS
### We are going to use CPU for Extract , Transform and Load data from Tensorflow Dataset, and parallelly GPU for training model parallelly.

## The code is available for the same in notebook file present in this notebook.


The blog for same will be available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/@novasush) soon.
