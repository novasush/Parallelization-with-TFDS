# ETL data on CPU and simultaneously Training model on GPU using TFDS
### We are going to use CPU for Extract , Transform and Load data from Tensorflow Dataset, and parallelly GPU for training model parallelly.

## The code is available for the same in notebook file present in this notebook. You can also run [this](https://github.com/novasush/Parallelization-with-TFDS/blob/master/TFDS_Parallel.ipynb) notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/novasush/Parallelization-with-TFDS/blob/master/TFDS_Parallel.ipynb).


The blog for same will be available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/@novasush) soon.
